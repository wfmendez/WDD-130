            <p><strong>Â¡Hola! </strong>Let me introduce myself. My full name is <em><strong>Wuillian Fernando Mendez
                    Garcia</strong></em>, and my nickname is "W.F. Mendez". I'm 24 years old and live
                     <strong>Turmero, Aragua, Venezuela</strong>.  I'm pursuing a Bachelor's of Applied Technology. This is my goal and my
            dream, and I'm studying hard for achieving it. My hobbies are: Reading books, programming, 
            learning new languages, playing video games, exercising, writing web novels, and watching series and movies. 
            I very like other things, but these are the principal.
            <strong>We are four in my family</strong>, my father, my mother, my sister, and me. I love them so much.
            Right now, I'm single, and I live in Venezuela with my sister, and, my aunt. I want to be a
                Full Stack Web Developer. I have a Digital Marketing and Software Develop Agency
        </p>
        <p><strong>I love to study at BYU-Idaho (<em>I believe that is the best university in the world</em>), all in
                the university is marvelous!</strong> I like the lessons, the instructors, the devotionals, the
            institute classes, and especially that I can learn of Jesus Christ while pursuing my Higher Education. 
                I selected Web Development as my major because my purpose is to obtain a better job to help
            more economically to my family. Also, I discovered that I love programming. The advantages of being a web
                designer are many. The technology revolution grows more each
            day, and job opportunities are abundant in the world more. I trust that the path of technology is full of
            professional possibilities and blessings for all.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I had the blessing that I was born in the everlasting covenant.</strong> My parents are members of
            the Church, and they were sealed in the Lima Temple. I'm very grateful for this marvelous blessing. I grew
            up with the teachings of the restored gospel, I was baptized on my 8th birthday. <strong>I served as a Missionary of
                the Church of Jesus Christ in my country</strong>, in the Venezuela
            Caracas Mission from 2016 to 2018. The Gospel of Jesus Christ influenced all my decisions of my life, I love
            Jesus Christ and his Restored Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>I have faith that My Heavenly Father can help me in my
            self-reliance, I believe in my divine potential, and I'm sure that if I endurance in god's commandments all
            things are possible. I like the scripture <strong><em>"And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is
                    impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible." </em></strong>(Mark 10:27).
